### Xfce 4.10

* `xfce-blue` is currently of unknown provenance.  While we are certain
  that the contributor licensed it to us in a manner compatible with
  xfdesktop's licensing, downstream distributors may choose to leave
  this one out if there is any discomfort with the status of this
  background.

## Historical Backgrounds

This is a simple list of some of the old backgrounds we used to ship in
earlier releases.  While we do not ship them any longer, they can be
found in xfdesktop's git history, in the
[`backgrounds/`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfdesktop/-/commits/master/backgrounds?ref_type=heads)
directory, with older releases in the
[`backdrops/`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfdesktop/-/commits/6caa4cc93893b16d7b2bf6f951038350074e85ee/backdrops?ref_type=undefined)
directory.
