	  settings aren't really handled all that intelligently yet, so
	  settings from different screens will clobber each other when they
	  get saved.

	  !! as a side-effect, it appears that i've fixed the crashing
	  problem when some threaded gnome apps are launched from the
	  desktop menu (as i hoped) !!

	* src/: menu-dentry.c, menu-file.c, menu-icon.c, menu.c,

	  the appearance of menu items:   style "xfdesktopmenu" {
	  font_name = "Times New Roman 16"   }	 widget "*xfdesktopmenu*"
	  style "xfdesktopmenu"   i intend to turn this into a real feature
	  eventually, not just an   rc-file hack.

	  * simplified icon sizing code, will work with the rc-theming and
	   eliminates the allocaiton of a PangoContext

	  * tweaked a couple things to reduce some memory allocations

	* ChangeLog: Update ChangeLog

2003-01-18 08:51  xfce

	* src/: backdrop.c, main.c: * Remove double buffering in desktop
	  window otherwise gtk allocates twice the size of the screen in
	  video memory which can show to be unusable even on a GeForce II
	  MX with 32Mb using 3D because the video RAM alloted to pixmaps
	  cannot handle the total amount of pixmaps.  * Reduce scale
	  quality to BILINEAR instead of HYPER because it takes too long
	  even on a PIV 1.7GHz scalling from 1024x768 to 1280x768

2003-01-16 15:51  xfce
